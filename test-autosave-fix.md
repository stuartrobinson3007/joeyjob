# Autosave Fix Verification

## What was fixed
The form editor was automatically trying to save when opened due to the autosave hook being initialized with fallback data, then detecting the transition to real backend data as a "change".

## Solution Applied
Added conditional autosave initialization:
- Added `enabled` option to `AutosaveOptions` interface
- Modified `useUnifiedAutosave` to skip all autosave logic when `enabled: false`
- Updated form editor to only enable autosave when real data is loaded: `enabled: !!currentFormData && formEditorState.status === 'loaded'`

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Before Fix (Old Behavior):
1. Form editor opens
2. Autosave hook initializes with fallback data
3. Backend loads real form data
4. Autosave detects fallback→real data as "change"
5. **Unwanted auto-save triggered** 🚨

### After Fix (New Behavior):
1. Form editor opens
2. Autosave hook initializes with `enabled: false` (no real data yet)
3. Backend loads real form data
4. Autosave enables with `enabled: true` and initializes with real data
5. **No auto-save triggered** ✅
6. User makes actual changes → autosave works as expected

## Console Logs to Look For

When opening form editor, you should now see:
```
📥 [FormEdit] Backend data loaded, dispatching FORM_LOADED
⏸️ [Autosave] Disabled, skipping data change detection
🔄 [Autosave] Initialized with data, ready for change detection
```

Instead of the old problematic:
```
📝 [Autosave] Data changed, scheduling save...
🔄 [Autosave] Starting auto save...
```

## Manual Testing Steps
1. Open any form editor in the app
2. Check browser dev console
3. Verify no auto-save is triggered on open
4. Make a change to the form
5. Verify autosave works after user changes
